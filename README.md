# labview-hmi-AutomatedProductionMachine
(Academic Project) We designed a system to monitor the temperature of an automated bottle production machine as well as appended a HMI to an existing system to track the number of times an actuator gets activated in an automated bottle  cap sealer on the factory floor. The objective was to create a fully functional soft drink monitoring system.
